"""The invoicing ledger: what a client owes, and what settled it.

Four tables and one rule that shapes all of them:

    Stored status is a decision a human took.
    Derived status is a fact about money and time.

`Invoice.status` therefore holds only decisions — someone issued it,
someone voided it, someone gave up on it. Whether an invoice is paid,
partially paid or overdue is computed from its allocations and its due
date, never written down. Peers that store `overdue` need a job to set
it and compensating SQL to unset it when a due date moves, and every
query downstream has to remember to say `IN ('unpaid', 'overdue')`.

Nothing here is jurisdiction-specific. The schema carries *shapes* — a
document type, a fiscal reference, a competence date — and the
jurisdiction packs (`app/fiscal/`) carry the vocabulary that fills them.
Brazil is the stress test because it is among the most demanding, not
because the model is shaped around it: the same tables serve a French
freelancer issuing a Factur-X invoice and a US contractor issuing
nothing at all.

#: Decisions a human takes about an invoice. Closed, and closed on

#:
#:   draft         — being written. Mutable, deletable, counted nowhere.
#:   open          — issued. Carries a number, appears in receivables.
#:   void          — cancelled. Keeps its number, reads as zero, terminal.
#:   uncollectible — given up on. Leaves aging, never counts as paid.

#: derived (see `invoice_service.derive_state`).
INVOICE_STATUSES = ("draft", "open", "void", "uncollectible")

#: UNTDID 1001 document types, by their common names. Only `invoice`
#: (380) is accepted today; `credit_note` (381) is reserved so the column
#: exists before the feature does, because adding it later means
#: backfilling every row in every self-hosted install.
INVOICE_DOCUMENT_TYPES = ("invoice", "credit_note")

#: Which side of the ledger a document sits on.
#:
#:   receivable — we issued it; the money comes in
#:   payable    — we received it; the money goes out
#:
#: Kept **separate from `document_type`** rather than folded into a single
#: four-value enum (out_invoice / out_refund / in_invoice / in_refund, as
#: some accounting systems do). They answer different questions — which
#: direction the money moves, and what kind of document this is — and
#: crossing them means every new document type doubles the enum.
#:
#: Everything issued today is `receivable`. `payable` exists now because
#: supplier invoices are a stated direction for this module, and a column
#: added later is a migration over every row in every self-hosted install.
INVOICE_DIRECTIONS = ("receivable", "payable")

#: Who authored the document. `imported` rows are reconstructed from an
#: external system (a payment gateway, a CSV): that system owns the document,
#: and Securo owns the cash that settled it.
INVOICE_ORIGINS = ("local", "imported")

#: How an allocation came to exist.
#:
#: Deliberately **not** a closed set. `manual` is a person pointing at a
#: transaction; everything else is the **id of the matching strategy that
#: produced the row**, and those ids come from the reconciliation policy —
#: a document the user will eventually edit, not an enum this file owns.
#: Closing this tuple would mean a migration every time somebody adds a
#: strategy, which is the opposite of the point.
#:
#: What it buys: the ledger can answer *why* a link exists and not merely
#: that it does. "Matched by: same client, net of withholding" is a
#: sentence; `payee_join` was a shrug.
