"""Invoice ledger: issuing, settling, and reading what is owed.

The one rule this module exists to enforce: **stored status is a
decision, derived status is a fact**. Four stored values (`draft`,
`open`, `void`, `uncollectible`) record what a person did. Everything a
reader actually wants to know — is it paid, partly paid, late, how late
— is computed here, from allocations and the due date, every time it is
asked for.

The cost of the alternative is visible in every peer product that stores
`overdue`: a nightly job to set it, compensating SQL to unset it when a
due date moves, and a permanent tax on every query downstream that has
to remember the state is really two states.
