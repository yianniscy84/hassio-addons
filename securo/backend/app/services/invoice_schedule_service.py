"""Recurring invoices: the agreement, its price over time, and the job.

The organising rule is the ledger's own, applied one level up: **the
schedule is an agreement, the invoice is the money**. Nothing here
counts as revenue, owed or paid; every such figure is computed from the
invoices a schedule emitted or was given. What the schedule adds is the
one thing invoices cannot say: what was agreed, from when, and when and
why it stopped.

## Periods

Period `n` (1-based) starts at `start_date` advanced `n - 1` times by
the frequency, day of month clamped in shorter months and recovered
afterwards, and ends the day before period `n + 1` starts. That is all
the calendar there is: no separate "next run" date to drift, no
timezone column to disagree with the anchor. The job compares period
starts against the UTC date; a retainer due on the 1st is emitted on
the 1st UTC, which is the same day everywhere that matters for a
document dated by the day.

## Terms

The price is a list of terms, each `effective_from` a date. A period is
priced by the latest term on or before its start. A term may be added,
changed or removed only while no invoice answers for a period it
governs; once one does, the term is history and history is not edited.
There is no proration by design: a change applies from a period
boundary, and a mid-period difference is an ordinary one-off invoice.

## The cursor

`next_sequence` is the period the job emits next. At creation it is the
first period starting on or after today: a schedule anchored in the
past does not back-fill months the user may have billed by hand (those
are linked, see `link_invoice`). Together with the unique
`(schedule_id, sequence)` on invoices, the cursor is what makes a
retried or doubled job a no-op.
