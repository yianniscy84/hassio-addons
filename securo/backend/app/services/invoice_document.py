"""The rendered invoice: one resolved document, two renderers.

The screen and the PDF must agree, forever. The way they do that here is
that neither of them decides anything: `build_document` resolves the
invoice, its snapshot and the workspace's identity into one plain
structure, and both renderers only lay it out. A field that appears on
the PDF but not on screen is a bug in one renderer, never a difference
of opinion about what the document says.

What is resolved, and in what order, is the whole subject:

  - **The snapshot wins.** It is what the document said when it was
    issued. A logo changed in September must not reach August's invoice,
    and a client renamed after the fact must not rename itself on a
    document they already hold.
  - **Live settings fill only what the snapshot never captured** — an
    invoice issued before a field existed, or a draft that has not been
    issued at all and therefore has no snapshot yet.

Nothing here is jurisdiction-specific. Whether the document reads as a
fiscal instrument or as a commercial request for payment is a matter of
what the workspace configured and what the reader's law says — the same
bytes serve a French auto-entrepreneur and a Brazilian MEI whose NFS-e
was issued at the prefeitura.
