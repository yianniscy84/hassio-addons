/**
 * Shared "from → to" range formatting for the transactions filter bar
 * (chip and picker trigger) and the Reports custom date-range picker. Both
 * need the same three shapes — a closed range, and each one-sided bound —
 * differing only in whether the year is shown: the full form for a trigger
 * label with room to spare, the compact form for a tight chip or an active
 * segment where the year would just add noise.
 *
 * Callers are expected to guard the fully-empty case themselves (there is no
 * sensible range label for `from === '' && to === ''`), matching how the
 * transactions filter bar and date-range picker already gate on it before
 * calling in.
