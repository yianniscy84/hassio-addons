"""Invoicing ledger routes.

Every route is gated twice: `require_module(INVOICES)` asks whether this
workspace has the module at all, and the write variant additionally asks
whether the member's role may write. A personal workspace gets a 404
from all of them — the same answer it would get for a URL that does not
exist, which is the honest thing to say to a client that should not know
the feature is there.
